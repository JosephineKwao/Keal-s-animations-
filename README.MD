This project, developed by Josephine Kwao, is a lightweight web-based application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring a clean and structured layout that is easy to customize and expand; to use it, simply open the giphy.html file in any modern browser, and planned improvements include adding JavaScript functionality for enhanced interactivity, making the design fully responsive for mobile and tablet devices, and introducing a dark mode toggle to improve accessibility and overall user experience.
